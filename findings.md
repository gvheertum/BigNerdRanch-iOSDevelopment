# Personal findings and notes
This file contains a list of findings and notes from my walkthrough of the iOS Programming book of Big Nerd Ranch. Again, this is just for playing and experimenting. Some of the iOS basics are already covered by the other repository, this book will deepen the building for iOS.

## Setting up / First iOS
- The first steps regarding the setup of a iOS project is covered in chapter 1 of the book, however, this overlaps with the other book, so this chapter is skipped.
- The third edition of the book is using XCode 4.3, so some things might have changed in newer versions, my development is done on XCode 9.
- The MVC pattern in the book is "explained" as: 
    - Model -> the objects that are used and mutated by the application
    - Controller -> The controller class created in the projects (responsible for coordination between the other layers)
    - View -> The separate elements on the screen (no real view class, but a collection of elements being the view)
- Chapter 2 of the book covers the basics of Objective-C, so we'll skip that one ðŸ¤ 
- Chapter 3 is memory management and ARC (ref count), this is covered in the book for Objective-C and therefor skipped by me. However memory and references are covered in the other book about Swift.
